# Hangman-Game
A Hangman app created using HTML/CSS/JS and deployed on Github Pages (boothr16.github.io/Hangman-Game). The app leverages Fetch API to connect to interface with an online dictionary in order to a generate random word at the start of each game.

TODO:
1) Create "hint" function to show the user the definition of the hidden word when the user has only one guess remaining. The definition will be pulled from the same API as the word.
